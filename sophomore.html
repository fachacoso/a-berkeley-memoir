						<h2>League of Legends<span>05</span></h2>
						<p> 
							This year marks the year I fell in the hole which is known as League of Legends
							</br> </br>
							With sophomore year being a constantly busy time for me, paying for Xbox Live (a paid subscription that allows me to play with friends) became not worth.  Eventually I cancelled my subscription, but fortunately some of my friends back home started playing a game that didn't need to be a expensive gaming PC, League.  I was hesitant to pick it up at first as it was a game that I had no idea how to play, but with my friends playing it, as well as some of my friends I met in Berkeley being pretty huge fans, I caved.
							</br> </br>
							Surprisingly enough, even past sophomore year, League has been a way for me to keep in touch with friends, make new connections with old friends, make new friends, and all the good memories that came with it.

						<h2>PASS<span>04</span></h2>
						<p> 
							As a high schooler, I had many insecurities regarding going to college: cost, ability to move away, being able to handle the academic rigor, etc.  It wasn't until I was invited to an event called Senior Weekend 2017 that I was given the opportunity to learn more about college and eventually felt confident that UC Berekeley was a place that I could succeed in.  The organization that invited me was called PASS.  Two years later, I eventually became one of the leaders in that very organization.
							</br> </br>
							PASS stands for Pilipinx Academic Student Services, and it is part of an umbrella organization called Bridges whose aim is to recruit high school and transfer students and retain college students.  As Public Relations Coordinator, I was tasked on creating and executing marketing for events we had as well as document those events.  It was a perfect blend between my creative skills regarding photography and design as well as a platform to help students just like me in my own way.  And throughout my time, I've worked alongside such amazing and passionate individuals to acheive feats and impact others that we could've only acheived together.  
							</br> </br>
							Much love to PASS 34!

						<h2>Coding<span>03</span></h2>
						<p> 
							print("Hello world")
							</br> </br>
							Nearing the end of my first year at Cal, I was panicking because I was going into my second year and I still didn't know what I wanted to major in.  So, after a long 3 AM conversation with some of my upperclassmen friends from the Avalon Club, they suggested for me to try Data Science.  I was definitely hesitant as I had never coded before, and I knew if I went this route I'd need to take scary, infamous classes such as CS 61A and 61B, but I didn't really have an alternative and decided to sign up for Data 8.
							</br> </br>
							In my fall semester I took Data 8, and it soon became my favorite class I had taken in Berkeley.  Seeing how you could taken something as simple as a table of data and come up with such meaningful observations and conclusions from them was something I thought was magical.  I loved the class so much that I decided to continue studying Data Science and continue being a part of Data 8 as a lab assistant (and spoiler alert, eventually a uGSI!).
							</br> </br>
							In my spring semester I took the infamous CS61A.  Remember when I said Data 8 was my favorite class?  Yeah, no.  CS61A is my favorite class in Berkeley hands-down.  I love this class with a passion.  It just clicked form me.  This is the class that made me feel confident in pursuing a career in coding.

						<h2>Nights at Mikaela’s<span>02</span></h2>
						<p> 
							With the chaos that was my sophomore year, I often needed a breather from constant group studying, organization work, and even from going out with friends.
							</br> </br>
							In order to get that breather I'd go to my friend Mikaela's apartment.  Almost anytime I'd stop by just to have some company to do whatever.  Maybe to eat, or maybe to watch videos, to chill, to study, to take naps, really anything.  It was a place me and a group of friends could call their second home in Berkeley.

						<h2>Summer in Tokyo<span>01</span></h2>
						<p> 
							Moving to Berkeley, away from my home which I had lived for my entire life, was a huge step.  It didn't help that I was the first one out of my siblings and cousins to leave and I had no one else to help me out.  But I did it.
							</br></br>
							How about travelling to a different continent altogether?  Definitely felt outside my comfort zone, but decided to apply for UC Berkeley's Global Internship program for Tokyo, Japan anyways.  And guess what?  Passed the interview for a program, landed an internship, dropped the news bomb on my family and flew to Tokyo to live and work there for a whole summer!
							</br></br>
							7:00am Wake up.  7:42am Get on the train.  8:30amArrive at my internship.  12:00pm Have a quick lunch.  5:30pm get off.  5:45 Get on the train.  6:30pm Arrive at home.  7:00pm Gym with friends.  9:00pm Eat dinner.  10:00pm Relax.  12:00am Sleep.
							</br></br>
							A normal day's schedule, but alongside all of that was spontaneous trips, beautiful views, amazing food, and even a surprise trip to the top of Mt. Fuji!
							</br></br>
							Honestly, looking back, this was definitely my favorite accomplishment throughout my time in college, and I'm grateful for all the people who encouraged me to apply and follow through with this, as well as proud of myself for acheiving something high-school-senior-me could only dream about.  Till next time Japan!
