# A Berkeley Memoir
Personal website I designed containing highlights of my time as a student at UC Berkeley.  
Each page contains my top five memories, top five songs for that school year, and images that relate to them.

**This website was created as a way to culminate my knowledge of web development, design principles, and how to thoughtfully interconnect the two.**

All **code** (HTML, CSS, Javascript), **design**, and **photography** were done by me.

## Features

## Dynamic Image Carousel
A dynamic image carousel is created for each memory in the "Memory" view.  Using javascript, the browser finds how many images should be in the image carousel and adjusts the indicators associated with each memory.  This flexible approach allows for a user to not hardcode anything in the HTML and add as many photos as they would like.

## Scrolling Responsiveness

### Home Page
The home page contains a parrallax effect in which the foreground moves faster than the background when scrolling to give a 3D feel.  The photo (as well as the foreground layer separated using Photoshop) leads to a dark background which leads to the second section of my website. In order to subconsciously push users to scroll, I added a start up animation to do so. 

### Year Page
Scrolling responsiveness is also present in the years pages where as you scroll down the opacity of the cover image decreases and the button's opacity increases.  Once we enter either the "Memory" or "Song" view, images and texts fade in and out in order to allow users to focus on the new material appearing before them
